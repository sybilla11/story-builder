# Type/Code frontend dev exercise

## Instructions

For this exercise, you are tasked with implementing a choose-your-own-adventure style app, following the UI designs (which can be found under `designs/`) and the functional requirements as detailed further below.

A minimal starter setup for a Node-based app has been included to get you started. _You may build your solution based off of this, but you don't have to-- feel free to scrap it and start from scratch if desired. It's up to you what tools/frameworks you use._

Work on your implementation directly in this directory, and submit it to us by zipping it up and sending it to [lev@typecode.com](mailto:lev@typecode.com) _and_ [ian@typecode.com](mailto:ian@typecode.com), or by sharing a _private_ repository on Github with [LevKanter](https://github.com/LevKanter) and [ianlord](https://github.com/ianlord). As part of your solution, please fill in the "Running the dev environment" section in this README with instructions for spinning up the project (including installing any dependencies, etc). If you do submit a .zip, please omit any third-party installable dependencies (such as `node_modules/`).

You're not required to do the exercise in one sitting-- you can work on it over the course of multiple sittings if you want. We expect it to take approximately 6-12 hours, and will likely be curious, after reviewing your solution, how long it took you and which parts were most time consuming (please keep track of your time).

### Functional requirements

This exercise should run as a single page app in a browser. The only browser you're required to support is the latest version of Google Chrome. The included UI designs show examples of what the UI should look like at desktop viewport sizes, but we are looking for you to reinterpret the layout as you see fit, so that it stays sensible on smaller viewport sizes.

The app consists of a set of frames that the user navigates through via buttons. Only one frame is visible to the user at a time, and the frame always fills the entire viewport. If the contents of a frame are taller than the height of viewport, the frame's height should increase past the fold to fit all of its content, and the user should be able to scroll the page to see the entire frame. If the frame's contents are shorter than the viewport height, the frame should be exactly as tall as the viewport.

Each frame (except for the "Loading" frame discussed below) follows a common template. The actual frames and their contents are populated based on a story JSON file (`public/data/story.json`), which the app should load using AJAX upon initialization.

This JSON file includes a **frames** list of frame objects. Each frame object consists of the following fields (note that some of these fields are optional), that affect how the frame is rendered and how it behaves.

- **title** Header displayed for each frame.
- **body** Body content displayed for each frame. This field contains HTML, and may consist of one or multiple `<p>` elements.
- **img** An optional image, represented as a relative path to its source file, to be dislayed alongside the body content. Note that, if a frame does not include an `img`, its body content is rendered into two columns (using CSS columns). If the frame _does_ include an `img`, however, its body content is rendered in a single column, with the image next to it in its own distinct column. The body content doesn't wrap around the image if it's taller than the image - it just continues to grow in its column.
- **colors** A map of color hex values, containing the properties:
  - **bg** The background color of the entire frame.
  - **text** The foreground color used in the frame for text, borders, etc.
- **buttons** A list of button objects. A frame can have zero, one, or two buttons. If the frame has one button, the button is displayed in the frame's lower right corner. If the frame has two buttons, the first button is displayed in the lower left corner, the second in the lower right.
  - **text** The label to display for the button.
  - **linkindex** The index of a target frame to show when the user clicks the button. The frame's index is with respect to its index position in the **frames** list.

Each frame displays a frame number in its upper right corner. The frame number is derived from the frame's index position in the **frames** list. The 0 index frame's number is 1, the 1 index frame is 2, and so on.

While the request to load the story data is pending, a "Loading" frame is displayed. The text/colors of this frame are baked into the app. Once the story data has loaded, the first frame in the **frames** list should automatically be shown.

## Running the dev environment

_This section to be filled in by you._

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I have build this application using react 16. this has some default test dependencies. other than that I have not used any other dependencies.

- **Design Approach:**
  to keep the code and files minimal to reference I have used just 2 js files
- **Storybuilder.js** where I have mantained all the, Fetch and state handling logic, minimum error handling and the required field assigment using props.
- **Viewport.js** this js file contains all the JSX elements to be displayed like the frame, which occupies the entire viewport. the Main section which displays the story title, body and image. this is custom bordered to align the elments like Index number and left and right buttons on the border.
- **Viewport.module.css** Styles over entire application is mantained in one file.
  Challanging part: most challanging part was designing the text layout on the border.Tried to do some research if there are any css elements I can use to achieve this functionality. Finally I came up with using 2 extrs divisions bottomDiv and right div. The bottom div has 3 elements left button, middleDiv and Right button in flex display. In the right div I tried to fit the Index number display and right border. Thats the best I could do there. But this challange gave me a reason to continue my research to create such handy element.
